         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong many diſeaſes whiche do raigne in a Horſe, I haue ſeene that the foundering hath bene reputed the moſte difficult to be cured. And as the goute in man is accompted an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie incurable: ſo is the foundering in a Horſe (of moſt men) thought irrecouerable. I wiſhe I could as well heale the one, as (by Gods ſufferaunce) I can giue remedie for the other, I would as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent vnto you both, as I doo this one. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding accept this as it is, and refuſe it not, as ſundry curious &amp; ſcornfull Farriers haue done vnto me, who neither knowing howe to remedie the diſeaſe, nor willing to learne, haue reiected at my hands the vnderſtanding of the cure, and as it were, in ſpite of arte &amp; cunning, cut out the ſowles of the horſes feete (a thing commonly vſed among ſuche ignoraunt perſons) by whiche any Horſe ſo miſuſed ſhall neuer haue his feete ſound agayne, (whatſoeuer they promiſe you,) where by this which I do here ſet out, neither ſhall you once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue your horſes ſhoes, neither yet touch any part of his hoofe or feete, and yet ſhall your Horſe be as ſound as euer he was.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->When you haue layde on this Charge thus, you ſhall take two Linnen ragges dipped in the ſame Charge, with which two rags ſo dipped, you ſhall garter the Horſe aboue the knees of his two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legges ſomewhat harde.

Then let him be ſet vp, well dreſſed and couered, and ſo by little and little ride him a day or two, and then may you boldly iourney him, for it is riding that bringeth the Horſe to the perfectnes of his feete, and you ſhall finde our Horſe as ſounde as euer he was, for this cure is infallible.

               <head>Certayne notes touching this cure to bee obſerued.</head>
               <p>YOu ſhall not neede to take of the Horſes ſhoes, nor to touche them at all, except it be to amende them for ſome other needefull cauſe.</p>
               <p>You muſt after xxiiii. houres rubbe of the Charge from the Horſe backe.</p>
               <p>You muſte take of the Garters after xii. or xiii. houres, and rubbe his knees vp and downe with your handes, to put the numnes away.</p>
               <p>You ſhall alſo vnderſtande that I haue helped many Horſes, eyther withoute Viniger or Bole Armoniack, for that I haue bin in place where I could not haue it. I haue alſo vſed Oten meale when I could not haue wheate meale.</p>
               <p>I haue alſo healed a Horſe by letting him blood in the necke, when he woulde not bleede in the vaynes before preſcribed, and vſed and compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame blood, as aboue is written.</p>
               <p>I doo alſo ſeldome vſe the ſtanding of the horſe in a poole of water, as before is ſayde.</p>
               <p>But if you doo all, as is firſt written, it is the beſt and ſureſt way no doubt: but if you be in place where you can not attayne to all the premiſſes, you ſhall make good ſhifte with part of it. And ſurely I doo finde that it is the taking of the blood that is the cheefe and principall cauſe of the cure.</p>
               <p>And where I doo write alſo that you muſt take your Horſe in hande (to cure him) within xxiiii. howres after his firſt foundering, I thinke good to let you vnderſtande that it is beſt ſo to doo, and yet did I once helpe a Horſe of mine owne that
<pb facs="tcp:7636:5"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->
had bene foundered fiue dayes, and he was very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well cured, but he aſked foure or fiue dayes more to come to the perfectnes of his feete, then vſually the Horſes doo; that be taken in hande, as aboue ſayde.</p>
               <p>This cure hath alſo this vertue, that your Horſe beeing once cured, ſhall not commonly or neuer founder agayne. I neuer heard of any that ſo did but one, whiche was M. Edward Fytzgeraldes Horſe, whom he helped preſently agayne with the ſame cure, and he hath the ſame Horſe at this day as ſounde as euer he was.</p>
               <p>Thus muche I haue thought good to ſay tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the obſeruation of the cure vpon any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie; when you can not be in place to prouide you of all ſuch things as be requiſite for the ſame.</p>
